This is the WordPress theme for my personal website, where I experiment with the [Block Editor](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg). I wanted to do this project from scratch, and I have also minimized the number of active plugins.

The code structure is based on [Twenty Twenty](https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentyTwenty).

## Dependencies
Currently none ðŸŽ‰

## Active plugins
- [Yoast SEO](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo)
